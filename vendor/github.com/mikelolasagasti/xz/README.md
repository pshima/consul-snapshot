# LICENSE

This was originally released into the public domain by the AUTHORS.
Here it is licensed more explicitly as Zero-Clause BSD (0BSD) so that it can be
detected by automated tooling, and satisfy the legal requirements for vendor
integration for cases in which a "public domain" statement is not sufficient.

This Go package is a modified version of

     XZ Embedded  <http://tukaani.org/xz/embedded.html>

and the project adopted 0BSD for newer commits.
